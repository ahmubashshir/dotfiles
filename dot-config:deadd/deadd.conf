[buttons]
### This section describes the configurable buttons within the
### notification center and NOT the buttons that appear in the
### notifications

# Note: If you want your buttons in the notification center to be
#       squares you should verify that the following equality holds:
#       [notification-center]::width
#          == [buttons]::buttonsPerRow * [buttons]::buttonHeight
#             + ([buttons]::buttonsPerRow + 1) * [buttons]::buttonMargin

# Numbers of buttons that can be drawn on a row of the notification
# center.
buttonsPerRow = 6

# Height of buttons in the notification center (in pixels).
buttonHeight = 50

# Horizontal and vertical margin between each button in the
# notification center (in pixels).
buttonMargin = 2

# Labels written on the buttons in the notification center.  Labels
# should be written between quotes and separated by a colon. For
# example:
# labels = "VPN":"Bluetooth":"Wifi":"Screensaver"
#labels = " Settings":" Bluetooth":" Reboot"
#commands = "xfce4-settings-manager":"bluetooth toggle":"xfce4-session-logout --reboot --fast"

# Each label is represented as a clickable button in the notification
# center. The commands variable below define the commands that should
# be launched when the user clicks on the associated button.  There
# should be the same number of entries in `commands` and in `labels`
# commands = "sudo vpnToggle":"bluetoothToggle":"wifiToggle":"screensaverToggle"
